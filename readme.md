Yet to do   

## - marked as done

## 1. Heartbeat based bully handling (See the whole flow)
2. status: alive - if not used remove
## 3. Persist the users if they re-enter (UNWANTED)
4. Player UI (design and placeholder complete, implementation pending) - terminal debug selective copy full copy scroll fix, hide host elements for listerners, seekbar logic should only display song position not be modified manually)
5. Play songs in different laptops and check (file import logic for multiple os)
6. Handle songs being not avalable in other systems (simple dialog box of song not found in ui)
7. if two users join under same name, they are considered as duplicate instances of same user and host privileges is being shared. check or discuss whether they should be handled with ID or this can be ignored. (hash with username password combo) (mask the id again for securit and display that alone)
