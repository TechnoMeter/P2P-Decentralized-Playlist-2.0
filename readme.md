Yet to do   

## - marked as done

1. Heartbeat based bully handling (See the whole flow)
2. status: alive - if not used remove
3. Persist the users if they re-enter
4. Player UI (design and placeholder complete, implementation pending)
5. Play songs in different laptops and check
6. Handle songs being not avalable in other systems (simple dialog box of checking all peers and skipping will be enough)
7. if two users join under same name, they are considered as duplicate instances of same user and host privileges is being shared. check or discuss whether they should be handled with ID or this can be ignored.
